# average util was at roundabout 70%
#
# scale down seems too fast -> with a lot of instances, when re-balancing takes place, the consumerapps have a very low
# utilization for a short period of time -> overall utilization is below threshold, scale down starts, lag increases
# very fast -> wenn re-balancing is finished, nodes have way too much load, so new instances are created and re-balancing
# happens again
#
# but also, scale down is too slow after a strong workload spike - it does not scale down at all and average utilization
# goes below 50%
