# on startup, there is still some major lag building up
#
# scaledown seems a bit too volatile, but hard to estimate - lag is at least under control, replicas are
# at an all-time minimum
#
# average level of replicas was at ann all-time minimum, scale down happened very fast, lag was under control for most
# time
#
# average CPU utilization was higher, at roundabout 70%, as well as average message latency
