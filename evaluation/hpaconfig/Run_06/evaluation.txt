# !!! LOOKS GOOD FIRST, TURNS OUT AS BAD SOLUTION
# seems like the best configuration so far
# little lag build up
# lowest amount of instances, way lower than in cpu_5 run
# -> maximum of 15! instances, compared to 24 in other runs
# average utilization was between 80-85%
# latency was totally fine, even better than in other runs
# scale down was not too aggressive, rather kinda accurate
#
# 90% seems to high, at 40k messages it does not scale fast "enough", does not scale up at all and lag increases endlessly
# -> scale up window may too big in combination with 90% target load
