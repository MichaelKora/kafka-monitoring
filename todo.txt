Things left To-Do (Feel free to add or put your name behind a task if you are working on it):

- Change SetUp so that applications run on the from us prior agreed Node (Consumer alone, Producer + Kafka on same)
- Get 2nd cluster running
- Look at consumer operation
- Run different scenarios & fill in matrix accordingly
- Extend workload matrix (/evaluation)
- Adjust Dashboard (#messages sent at which time, Maybe Config values)
