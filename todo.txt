Things left To-Do (Feel free to add or put your name behind a task if you are working on it):

- Change SetUp so that applications run on the from us prior agreed Node (Consumer alone, Producer + Kafka on same) [Jonathan]
- Get 2nd cluster running [Benji]
- Look at consumer operation, calculate Stuff based on example data value [Benji]
- Let Producer use example data (Traffic/Electro) to upload to Kafka [Benji]
- Run different scenarios & fill in matrix accordingly
- Extend workload matrix (/evaluation)
- Adjust Dashboard (#messages sent at which time, Maybe Config values)

Questions:
- Is topic recreated with every new start of a scenario? Do we need to recreate the topic manually? 
- How to read in file? Same amount of data points for each scnario but sent in differen pattern? Add both datasets to container so we can choose ? Add datasets to container? Send multiple times same file to Kafka?
